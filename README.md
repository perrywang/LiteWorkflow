# LiteWorkflow
Lightweight event driven workflow execution engine.

## Core concepts  

**Workflow** static workflow definition   
**WorkflowPhase** static workflow state representation   
**WorkflowAction** called by specific event handler at specific lifycycle. Notification, Approval are both as actions
**WorkflowTransition** connecting from and to WorkflowPhase with TransitionCondition  
**ActionLifecycle** static enum lifecycle point to define action execution time line such as **WORKFLOW_STARTING**, **PHASE_ENTERING**  
**WorkflowExecution** An instance for workflow running  
**ExecutionContext\<T\>** running context to relate data and state transfer between whole execution lifecycle. Type \<T\> is used to describe data type  
**Event** workflow execution event such as **WorkflowStartingEvent**, **WorkflowStartedEvent**, **WorkflowPhaseEnteringEvent**, **WorkflowPhaseEnteredEvent**  
**EventBus** event pub sub system to decouple workflow action execution process using Spring ApplicationEventPublisher   
**ExecutionEngine** is the driver to trigger event on execution and other tasks such as providing if concurrent execution strategy
